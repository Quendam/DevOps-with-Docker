# Testing
For some reason this excersice would not run on my home linux server and I had to use my work laptop for it. 
Result was always:
backend-2.7 exited with code 132
training-2.7 exited with code 132

It did run on my Mac tho 
peekoo@Petris-MacBook-Pro 2.7 % docker-compose up
Recreating training-2.7 ... done
Recreating backend-2.7  ... done
Recreating frontend-2.7 ... done
Attaching to training-2.7, backend-2.7, frontend-2.7
...

For a while it built models for cucumbers and moped and then backend started to answer. Then tried some pic of both and 3/4 the app got right. Attached images from testing...

# Testing
Had some trouble figuring out the correct syntax of nginx.conf but after a while got it to pass api to backend container.

Tested it out from outside and got frontend container from port 80 and it pinged correctly to port 80 

Was not sure if the database and redis was supposed to be in this excercise but they didn't seem to hurt so left them in.

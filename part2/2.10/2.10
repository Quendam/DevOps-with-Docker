# Changes and testing
Only major change needed seemd to be API_URL=http://192.168.1.50/api environment variable for frontend. 
This is because backend is now proxied by nginx to backend container.

Backend had already info on where frontend container is found at.

Attached testing png 2.10 for browser view of thesting

peekoo@acies:~/DevOps-with-Docker/part2/2.4$ peekoo@acies:~/DevOps-with-Docker/part2/2.4$ docker-compose up -d --scale compute=5

Decided to go with 5 nodes, just to see what happens :)

# Testing

Opened http://192.168.1.50:3000 in browser. Small delay later requests were answered by compute nodes and got back "Congratulations!".

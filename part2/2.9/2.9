# Testing
peekoo@acies:~/DevOps-with-Docker/part2/2.9$ docker-compose up -d
Starting postgres-2.9 ... done
Starting redis-2.9    ... done
Starting frontend-2.9 ... done
Starting backend-2.9  ... done

First checked that database directory had some content, it seemd like postgres files. Then added few messages and tested with some docker-composer down/up cycles and data seems to persist.

Deleted datavbase directory and like one would expect the data was gone. 

Attached some pics again from browser view.

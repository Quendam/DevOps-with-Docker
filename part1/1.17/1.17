# Description
As a php develper, I have to opt for LAMP server as container. Not really sure if this is what was supposed to do.

Since all the things I develop are run either at backend by php or on frontend (by browser js) I'll do the  LAMP server.

At work our server are mostly debian based and we use Mariadb as database so those will go in.

# Build
peekoo@acies:~/DevOps-with-Docker/part1/1.17$ docker build -t quendam/my-dev-env .

# Run 
peekoo@acies:~/DevOps-with-Docker/part1/1.17$ docker run -d --name localdev -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 22:22 -v $(pwd)/html/:/var/www/html/ -v $(pwd)/logs/:/var/log/apache2 my-dev-env

default credentials for ssh and mysql are :
dev / Qwerty12345

# Testing
Changed local dir ownership to my user and added info.php to html. See info-php.png

Logged in to phpmyadmin at /phpmyadmin with default creds added "My development database" to see that rights are set correctly. See phpmyadmin.png

# Publish
docker push quendam/my-dev-env
